Code Review:
- Game loops -> add in ability to jump back to start screen. // working on.
- Exceptions/errors/boundary conditions. Program shouldn't crash on invalid input.
- Endgame = no change between two generations. Steady states are infinite.
- Fix variable names, constants, magic numbers, ternary, change from string concat to string interpolation, etc.
